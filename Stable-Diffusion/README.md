# Stable Diffusion - High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models #

Stable Diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model, trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. 
Similar to Google's Imagen, this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts.
With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 10GB VRAM.
