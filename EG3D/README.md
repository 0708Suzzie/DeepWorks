# EG3D - Efficient Geometry-aware 3D Generative Adversarial Networks #
Unsupervised generation of high-quality multi-view-consistent images and 3D shapes using only collections of single-view 2D photographs has been a long-standing challenge. Existing 3D GANs are either compute-intensive or make approximations that are not 3D-consistent; the former limits quality and resolution of the generated images and the latter adversely affects multi-view consistency and shape quality. EG3D techniques improves the computational efficiency and image quality of 3D GANs without overly relying on these approximations.
