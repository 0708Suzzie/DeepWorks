# BCI - Brain Computer Interface 
COMPUTER VISION IS MUCH FASTER THAN HUMANS IN SOME WELL DEFINED RECOGNITION TASKS. HOWEVER, THE ACCURACY DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING DATASETS, THE QUALITY OF IMAGE ANNOTATIONS AND THE ADAPTATION OF ALGORITHMS FOR SPECIFIC TASKS.

THE HUMAN BRAIN IS A POWERFUL INFORMATION PROCESSING MACHINE. IT OUTPERFORMS ANY COMPUTERIZED TECHNOLOGY WHEN IT COMES TO DEALING WITH NOVEL, ABSTRACT, OR FUZZY DEFINITION OF TASKS, DUE TO INCREDIBLE LEARNING EFFICIENCY AND COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY.

Combining Humans with Machine is the next frontier.
