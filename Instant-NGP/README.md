# Instant NeRF: Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Nvidia Research) # 

The new NVIDIA NGP Instant NeRF is a great introduction to getting started with neural radiance fields. 
With your own video and/or image dataset, you can compile the codebase, prepare your images, and train your first NeRF.
Unlike other NeRF implementations, Instant NeRF only takes a few minutes to train a great-looking visual. This video is all you need to convert a video or image to NeRF scenes on Ubuntu.

### Your build environment must have the following:
- Re-install CUDA Toolkit (1.17) latest with nvcc match with same toolkit (1.17) version 
- Install Python 3.9. If you are new to Python, this is not the latest version.
- Use CMake 3.22 and make sure that Python 3.9 is used to compile the codebase.
- Make sure G++ and gcc are latest and ffmpeg, colmap, qt packages are install


## Download and Build Library
Begin by cloning this repository and all its submodules using the following command:
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nvlabs/instant-ngp
$ cd instant-ngp
```

Building instant-ngp Library

```
instant-ngp$ cmake . -B build
instant-ngp$ cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo -j 16
```

### Package must be installed in machine to build instant-ngp library
- Python 3.9 with the following packages
  - colmap, opencv-python, opencv-python-headless, pyside6, pyqt6
- Ubuntu 22.02 must have the following library:
  - ffmpeg
  - colmap
  - qt5

### Commands for various operations - Generate NeRF files 
```
$ python scripts/colmap2nerf.py --video_in ~/Downloads/3dobj.mp4 --video_fps 10 --run_colmap --aabb_scale 4
$ python scripts/colmap2nerf.py --video_in ~/Downloads/aashil.mp4 --video_fps 5 --run_colmap --aabb_scale 4
$ python scripts/colmap2nerf.py --video_in ~/Downloads/avkash.mp4 --video_fps 5 --run_colmap --aabb_scale 4
$ python scripts/colmap2nerf.py --video_in ~/work/ngp-work/jcb/jcb.mp4 --video_fps 2 --run_colmap --aabb_scale 4 --out ~/work/ngp-work/jcb/transforms.json
$ python scripts/convert_image.py --input ~/work/ngp-work/gigapixel/tokyo-12gb.jpg  --output ~/work/ngp-work/gigapixel/tokyo_12gb.bin
$ ./build/testbed --scene ~/work/ngp-work/gigapixel/tokyo_10mb.bin
```

### Playing NeRF content - After NeRF content is created
- You will see that images folder will be geneated in the same folder from where the input video was located
- In the instant-ngp folder you will get the transform.json file as the NeRF output
- You need to open the transform.json usingthe testbed application which is compiled above 
- Please check the video to migrate both images and transform.json to other folder before launcing testbed
- You can move images folder and transform.json to a desired folder and make sure the path the images is updated into the transform.json based on images folder you just have moved.
- Finally open the transform.json using the command below with --scene paramter and path the transform.json

```
instant-ngp$ ./build/testbed --scene ~/work/[your-folder]/transform.json
```
