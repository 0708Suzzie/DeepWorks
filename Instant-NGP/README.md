# Instant NeRF: Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Nvidia Research) # 

The new NVIDIA NGP Instant NeRF is a great introduction to getting started with neural radiance fields. 
With your own video and/or image dataset, you can compile the codebase, prepare your images, and train your first NeRF.
Unlike other NeRF implementations, Instant NeRF only takes a few minutes to train a great-looking visual. This video is all you need to convert a video or image to NeRF scenes on Ubuntu.

### Your build environment must have the following:
- Re-install CUDA Toolkit (1.17) latest with nvcc match with same toolkit (1.17) version 
- Install Python 3.9. If you are new to Python, this is not the latest version.
- Use CMake 3.22 and make sure that Python 3.9 is used to compile the codebase.
- Make sure G++ and gcc are latest and ffmpeg, colmap, qt packages are install
