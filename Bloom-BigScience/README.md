# Bloom - BigScience  Language Model #

This hands-on programming tutorial with step by step implementation of Bloom Large Language Text Generation Model will guide you building your own text generation application in Google Colab environment. 

You will also learn to solve 3 different problems while working on this tutorial:

- RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cpu and cuda:0! (when checking argument for argument index in method wrapper__index_select)
- AttributeError: 'BaseModelOutputWithPastAndCrossAttentions' object has no attribute 'logits'
- GPU Memory Exception while loading Bloom models with tokenizer
