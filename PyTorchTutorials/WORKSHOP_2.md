# Workshop #2 - How to add Layers and Forward function to your neural network? #

Defining your neural network is an art and science together. 

You must know the following to be the successful: 

1. How to manage your input data requirement through a network of input, output and hidden layers 
2. How to write the forward function to process your input data to extract signals from it

This Deep Learning Workshop #2 covers the following:
- Creating your very Network Model with input, output and hidden layers and forward function
- Understanding input data features to setup correct Network Model
- Setting network model definition and forward functions to meet the data need
- Various structured and unstructured data based network design and coding
