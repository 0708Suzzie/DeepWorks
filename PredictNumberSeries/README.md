## Predict Number Series with Machine Learning (Regression) ##

This hands-on exercise is for those who wanted to generate number series using any mathematical function i.e. Quadratic equations. exponentials, logarithmic, trigonometric (Sin, Cos, Tan) in Python and then forecast newer sequence using machine learning regression methods. 

Combining pandas and numpy you are going to first general a mathematical number series and then using scikit-learn regression model you will generate or forecast the future numbers based on source number series... 

You will also use matplotlib to visualize the data and validate the new number series belong to the same source number series...
